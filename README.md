# EarthQuake App
Earthquake map using https://www.usgs.gov/ API for up to the minute updates.

# Technology Used
Java, Android Studios, Volley Library (for the HTTP requests), Maps SDK, and USGS API JSON data.

# Approach Taken
Model View Controller Architecture to keep code organized and effecient. UI: Full screen Icon map with click functionality. Highlights pop up with one more layer for full information about the earthquake.

# Challenges
Google Play Store upload and trouble shooting through the API credentials associated with it.

# Next Steps
Add drill down functionality similar to the full screen UI design for list of earthquakes.
